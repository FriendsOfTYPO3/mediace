Current state
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The latest version here reflects a feature-complete state. All newly based
features for media elements, are now part of the Fluid-based approach in TYPO3
implemented directly, however this extension serves as a solid foundation for
projects that have been using media content elements starting from TYPO3 4.0.
