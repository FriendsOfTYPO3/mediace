# TYPO3 Extension "mediace"

Adds media-based content elements with Flash or native HTML5 to your website.

The functionality was part of TYPO3, until TYPO3 CMS 7 LTS, and moved into its own
extension, receiving its own public repository.

## Installation
The latest version can be installed via TER (http://typo3.org) or via composer
by adding ''composer require friendsoftypo3/mediace'' in a TYPO3 CMS 7+ installation.

## Current state
The latest version here reflects a feature-complete state. All newly based features
for media elements, are now part of the Fluid-based approach in TYPO3 implemented directly,
however this extension serves as a solid foundation for projects that have been using
media content elements starting from TYPO3 4.0.

## Contribution
Feel free to submit any pull request, or add documentation, tests, as you please.
We will publish a new version every once in a while, depending on the amount of changes
and pull requests submitted.

### License
The extension is published under GPL v2+, all included third-party libraries are
published under their respective licenses.

### Authors
Over 100 contributors have been working on this area while this functionality was part of
the TYPO3 Core. This package is now maintained by a loose group of TYPO3 enthusiasts inside
the TYPO3 Community. Feel free to contact Benni Mack (benni.mack@typo3.org) for any questions
regarding "mediace".
